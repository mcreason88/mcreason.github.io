          Iâ€™m an engineering leader with a passion for developing innovative solutions and 
          mentoring others. I love developing and architecting, but my passion is to use my 
          technology experience to find new ways to unlock new potential opportunities and share 
          knowledge along the way. As a leader, I intend to be consistent, persistent and insistent 
          on quality standards of development.  While I'm a proficient full-stack
          developer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, micro services, 
	    stream processing, and async mechanisms).
        </p>
        <p>
           I love building things and the pride of seeing a finished project.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with tangible business justification.
           I'm looking to continute to collaborate and contribute in a development role where I can lead 
           a team through example and dedication to quality code standards.
